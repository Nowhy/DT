# DTï¼š Automated Creation of Puzzle games with Constraint Programming

This proposal aims to automatically generate levels of puzzle games, and measuring the difficulty of the resulting levels.

Abstract

There is a history of generating puzzles using A.I., from Chess problems to Sudoku levels. Recently there has been progress in generating puzzles, and also measuring the difficulty of these puzzles, for a human player. This project aims to extend this, and automatically generate levels of new puzzles using a constraint solver.

Objectives

The main aim of this project is to automatically generate puzzles. Depending on the student, this could also involve implementing a game, or performing experiments which measure how well the difficulty measure lines up with real users. Note that the quality of any created game is NOT a primary measure of how well the project has gone!

 

Skills

Programming skills will be required to design the basic system which integrates with a constraint solver. If the puzzle game is also implemented, experience of basic games programming in any language or system would be beneficial.

Artefact(s)
A system, using constraint solver, which automatically creates and measures the difficulty of puzzles, and at least one of:

            * A system which allows these games to played.

            * An experiment which shows how accurate the difficulty measure is.
